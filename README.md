# Movie-Recommendation-System
Ever wondered how streaming platforms like Netflix or Google suggest movies similar to the ones you already enjoy? With this project,I learned to build my own movie recommendation system using machine learning.

Types of Recommendation Engines
There are three primary types of recommendation engines:

Popularity-based Recommendation Engine
Content-based Recommendation Engine
Collaborative Filtering-based Recommendation Engine
Popularity-Based Recommendation Engine
The simplest recommendation engine is the popularity-based engine. This algorithm ranks movies based on their view counts, listing them in descending order from highest to lowest views. Platforms like YouTube or Netflix often use this to display trending lists. It’s straightforward but effective.

Content-Based Recommendation Engine
Content-based recommendation systems analyze the contents of a movie (such as storyline, genre, cast, director, etc.) that a user likes. It then identifies other movies with similar content and ranks them according to their similarity scores, recommending the most relevant ones to the user.

Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendation Engine
Collaborative filtering algorithms find similar users based on their activities and preferences (e.g., users who watch the same types of movies or movies by the same director). If user A has seen a movie that user B hasn’t seen yet, the movie will be recommended to user B, and vice versa. This approach relies on the collaboration between similar users' preferences, hence the name “Collaborative Filtering.” A common application of this algorithm is seen on Amazon, with lists like “Customers who viewed this item also viewed” and “Customers who bought this item also bought.”
